Week 1:
In the first week, we will focus on introducing you to the vast world of Data Science and 
specifically Machine Learning on a very high level (nothing scary). Additionally, we will provide 
you with resources to learn the basics of GIT, which will help you create your own portfolio. 
I believe learning from multiple sources can strengthen your understanding of these topics, and 
we will provide you with various resources to achieve that. It's crucial to have a high-level 
understanding of these topics, as it will help you identify which category of AI a problem falls 
under and what options you have to solve it.
One of the recommended resources is a four-hour video series by Professor Andrew NG (a 
Legend in the field), which you can watch over four to five days easily by dedicating one hour 
every day(easy). Another resource (My personal favorite) is the first few episodes of the 
Machine Learning Guide Podcast by Tyler Renelle, who is an excellent speaker and has 
transitioned from being a web developer to Machine Learning. Each episode is short, and you 
can easily listen to the first four episodes in a day or two.
Lastly, everyone should spend some time learning about Git and Github so that you can easily 
share your work on your GitHub profile, which can serve as your portfolio. 
I recommend starting with Andrew NG's playlist and then going to Tyler's Podcast. 
Please Keep in mind that it's perfectly normal not to understand everything, even if you 
understand 70% of these, it is a good success.
Here are the resources we recommend:

All of these resources can easily be completed in 1 week, and I hope to see some good progress 
and daily updates.
Bonus Task: 
If you complete these well before time, write an article on any of the topics which you loved the 
most via Medium. Having a good public presence is important.
