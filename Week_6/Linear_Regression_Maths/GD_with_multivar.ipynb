    "The warning \"overflow encountered in square\" suggests that some values in your computation are too large to be represented by the data type you are using, leading to an overflow error. This can cause the cost function to return NaN, which in turn can lead to NaN values for the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to address this issue is to scale your input data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This can help prevent overflow errors and also make your optimization process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you may want to try reducing the learning rate alpha to see if that helps stabilize the optimization process. A large learning rate can cause the optimization process to overshoot the minimum and diverge, leading to NaN values for the model parameters.\n",

    "You may also want to try using a different optimization algorithm, such as Adam or RMSprop, which can sometimes be more effective than plain gradient descent for deep learning problems."

    "The learning rate of our gradirnt descent algo is alpha (equals to 0.01), which is actually a hyperparameter that is controlling the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of a loss function. If we make it too large it must bring out bad results with loss funtcion leading to big strides and may be missing many points/extermas. While a small learning rate will bring out good results as it is slowily converging.It is always suggested to keep the value of learnig rate between 0 an 1.\n",
